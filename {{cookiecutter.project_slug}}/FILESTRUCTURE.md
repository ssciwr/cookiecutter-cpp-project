This is an explanation of the file structure that the cookiecutter
generated for you:

* C++ source files:
  * `include/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}.hpp` is the main
    C++ header that declares the interface of your library.
{%- if cookiecutter.header_only == "No" %}
  * `src/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}.cpp` is the main file that implements this library.
{%- endif %}
  * `app/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}_app.cpp` is an executable that uses the library.
    This can e.g. be used to provide a command line interface for your project.
  * `tests/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}_t.cpp` contains the unit tests for the library.
    The unit tests are written using Catch2. For further reading on what can be achieved
    with Catch2, we recommend [their tutorial](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/devel/docs/tutorial.md).
  * `tests/tests.cpp` is the Catch2 testing driver. You do not need to change
    this. Placing this in a separate compilation unit than the unit test
    implementation decreases the compilation time of the test suite.
{%- if cookiecutter.python_bindings == "Yes" %}
  * The `python/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug.replace("-", "") }}` directory contains a Python
    package for the project. It contains a compiled Python module `_{{ cookiecutter.project_slug.replace("-", "") }}`
    that CMake generates from the Pybind11 source file `python/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug.replace("-", "") }}/_{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}.cpp`. Additionally, it contains pure Python sources (e.g. `__init__.py`) that
    allow to wrap Python functionality around the compiled module.
{%- endif %}
* CMake build system files
  * `CMakeLists.txt` describes the CMake configuration script. You can find such files
    in many directories. When CMake runs, the `CMakeLists.txt` from the top-level directory
    executes top to bottom. Whenever a command `add_subdirectory(<dir>)` is executed,
    the `CMakeLists.txt` file from the directory `<dir>` is immediately executed. A comprehensive
    reference of CMake's capabilities can be found in the [official CMake docs](https://cmake.org/documentation/).
    A well-written, opinionated book for beginners and experts is [Modern CMake](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/).
{%- if cookiecutter.externals == "submodules" %}
* The `ext` directory contains any submodules that were added by the cookiecutter.
{%- endif %}
{%- if cookiecutter.externals == "vcpkg" %}
* The `vcpkg.json` file defines dependencies provided by [vcpkg manifest mode](https://vcpkg.io/en/docs/users/manifests.html).
{%- endif %}
* Documentation configuration files
{%- if cookiecutter.doxygen == "Yes" or cookiecutter.readthedocs == "Yes" %}
  * The Doxygen documentation is configured directly from `doc/CMakeLists.txt`.
    To further configure the build, you can check the [Doxygen Configuration Manual](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/config.html)
    for available options and add them with `set(DOXYGEN_<param> <value>)` before
    the call to `doxygen_add_docs`.
{%- endif %}
{%- if cookiecutter.readthedocs == "Yes" %}
  * `doc/index.rst` contains the actual text of the Sphinx documentation. It is written
    in *reStructuredText*, which is described in the [Sphinx documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html).
  * `doc/conf.py` configures the Sphinx documentation that is build for readthedocs.
    The file contains the default configuration of Sphinx that can be adapted according
    to their [Configuration Guide](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html).
    Additionally, the file contains build logic for readthedocs that integrates Doxygen
    output through `breathe`. For information on what is possible with `breathe`, check
    the [Breathe documentation](https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
  * `doc/requirements-rtd.txt` collect a list of dependencies that need to be installed
    on the Readthedocs build servers.
{%- endif %}
* Configuration for CI/Code analysis/Documentation services
{%- if cookiecutter.github_actions_ci == "Yes" %}
  * `.github/workflows/ci.yml` describes the Github Workflow for Continuous
    integration. For further reading on workflow files, we recommend the
    [introduction into Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions)
    and [the reference of available options](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).
{%- endif %}
{%- if cookiecutter.gitlab_ci == "Yes" %}
  * `.gitlab-ci.yml` describes the configuration for Gitlab CI. For further
    reading, we recommend [Gitlabs quick start guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/)
    and the [Gitlab CI configuration reference](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/yaml/)
{%- endif %}
{%- if cookiecutter.readthedocs == "Yes" %}
  * `.readthedocs.yml` configures the documentation build process at [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org).
    To customize your build, you can have a look at the [available options](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html).
{%- endif %}
{%- if cookiecutter.codecovio == "Yes" %}
  * `codecov.yml` configures the coverage checking from [codecov.io](https://codecov.io). The
    provided file is the default configuration plus suitable exclusions. For more options, check
    their [configuration reference](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-yaml).
{%- endif %}
{%- if cookiecutter.sonarcloud == "Yes" %}
  * `sonar-project.properties` configures the code analysis on SonarCloud. The provided
    default parameters should be sufficient for most users. If they are not for you,
    you should have a look at the [Analysis Parameters Reference](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/analysis-parameters/)
    and at the [Documentation for C/C++/Objective-C](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/languages/cfamily/).
  * `.github/workflows/sonarcloud.yml` is the Github workflow that triggers the SonarCloud
    analysis. The provided default should be sufficient for most users.
{%- endif %}
* Markdown files with meta information on the project. [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) is
  a good language for these files, as it is easy to write and rendered into something beautiful by your git repository
  hosting provider.
  * `README.md` is the file that users will typically see first when discovering your project.
  * `COPYING.md` provides a list of copyright holders.
{%- if cookiecutter.license != "None" %}
  * `LICENSE.md` contains the license you selected.
{%- endif %}
  * `TODO.md` contains a list of TODOs after running the cookiecutter. Following the
    instructions in that file will give you a fully functional repository with a lot
    of integration into useful web services activated and running.
  * `FILESTRUCTURE.md` describes the generated files. Feel free to remove this from the
    repository if you do not need it.
* Other files
  * `.gitignore` contains a default selection of files to omit from version control.
  * `.gitmodules` tracks the state of added submodules
{%- if cookiecutter.python_bindings == "Yes" %}
  * `setup.py` describes the Python package build process. This file enables you to also
    install your software using e.g. `pip`.
  * `pyproject.toml` provides information about the Python project and its toolchain.
    `pip` uses this file before even executing `setup.py` to determine dependencies
    of the build process itself. Additionally, it can be used to configure tools like `pytest`.
{%- if cookiecutter.pypi_release == "Yes" -%}
    Additionally, this file is needed for the automated release process to PyPI.
  * `.github/workflows/pypi.yml` defines the workflow that deploys to PyPI. The
    configuration of this workflow is done in `pyproject.toml`.
{%- endif %}
  * `python/tests/test_python_bindings.py` defines a simple unit test suite for the Python
    bindings that is based on [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/contents.html).
    `requirements-dev.txt` collects the required Python packages for running this
    test suite, they can be installed with `python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.
    The `pytest` run is configured in the `tools.pytest` section of `pyproject.toml`.
